This project receives 4 or more audio channels to the input and outputs the first active audio channel in order of priority. 
If there is at least one active channel, then the logic unit is supplied to the LED and AMP outputs, thereby including a relay 
for the sound amplifier and an LED. The number of channels, sensitivity settings, pins can be configured in the settings. 
There are also other settings in the maine. All settings are well documented. There are tinctures that allow you to take 
measurements with different frequencies, individual for each channel, and much more.

Harware requirements
Code is written for STM32F103C8T6. Also you can use chinees' analogue.

Circuit and circuit board 
You can find circuit, circuit board and gerber-files(needed for to order circuit board) in /Eagle/ directory. You can order the circuit board in <a href="https://JLCPCB.com">JLCPCB.com</a>.
It is very cheap, only $ 2 for 5 pcs.
